# Hello Vulkan

A simple Hello World application in Vulkan.

## Description

This code demonstrates Vulkan initialisation and displays a 3D object with simple lighting. It is based heavily on the [Vulkan Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/) and most of it is copied verbatim with some stylistic changes. It uses GLFW, GLM, fmtlib, tinyobjloader, and the stb libraries.
